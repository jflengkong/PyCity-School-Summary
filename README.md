# Week 4 - Pandas Challenge 
This week we were challenged to use our pandas and Jupyter Notebook skills to create a report that includes the following data. This will include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data that has been calculated through pandas and the datasets provided.

## Local Government Area (LGA) Summary 
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
1. Total number of unique schools
2. Total students
3. Total budget
4. Average maths score
5. Average reading score
6.% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

## School Summary 
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school.
Include the following:
1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average maths score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
